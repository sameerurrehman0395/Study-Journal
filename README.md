# Study Journal ‚Äî AIOps EduQual Level 6

Welcome to my **Study Journal**, a personal documentation of my journey through the **AIOps EduQual Level 6** training program offered by **Alnafi International School**.  

This repository serves as a structured record of what I learn, practice, and reflect on across four major domains ‚Äî **Cyber Security**, **SysOps**, **DevOps**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  

It is designed as both a **revision guide** for myself and a **knowledge-sharing resource** for anyone interested in technical learning, automation, and operations in modern IT environments.
